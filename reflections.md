## Terminal Basics
Commands like pwd, ls, and cd are all commands to help you get around the terminal. **PWD** tells you where you are in the computer file system at the moment.
**LS** lists all of files in your current directory. And **CD** changes what directory you are in. Just **CD** by itself will take you back to your home directory.

## Git Commands
- In order to clone a repository you type the command **_gh repo clone_**
- Hidden Files are prefixed with a **_'.'_**
- If you type **_ls -a_** then it will show you all directories and files.
- **_git status_** updates you on the repository
- **_git add (file name)_** adds file to staging area
- **_git commit -m 'message'_** commits the changes your local repository.
- And if you do **_git push_** then it will push your changes from your local repository to your remote repository.
- **_git log_** shows the commit history in your repository

## GIT vs GITHUB
- Git is a version control system for developers to track code
- GitHUB is a hosting service for git repositories
- A terminal is a text based software designed to navigate and work around the computer.
- Terminals are more efficient then GUI when you get comfortable with the commands.

I think that Git and Github drastically help developers. Because your saves are not automatic. Therefore, you can optimally add changes without breaking what you already have there.
